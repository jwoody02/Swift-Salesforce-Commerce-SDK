Both operators are permitted unless the API documentation states otherwise.\n* A subset of Commerce APIs handle queries with multiple fields differently. If the query has multiple fields, the query is internally handled as a logical `OR` of `DisjointMaxQueries` (with the dismax matching a value against all fields).
